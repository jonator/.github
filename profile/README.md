# Osmosis Labs

Repositories for the Osmosis blockchain and tooling for Cosmos.

The Osmosis blockchain is a decentralized network, ran by 100+ validators and full nodes, with many front-ends and development teams on it.

Documentation can be found at [docs.osmosis.zone](https://docs.osmosis.zone/).

## State machine

- [osmosis](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis) - A node implementation for the Osmosis chain, built with a [fork](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk) of the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
- [LocalOsmosis](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis) - One-click local Osmosis testnet and ecosystem for rapid prototyping. Inspired by LocalTerra.

Go to https://get.osmosis.zone to quickstart setting up a node!

## Frontend

- [telescope](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/telescope) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osmonauts/telescope)) - Protobuf transpilation tooling, to easily setup TypeScript clients to interact with Cosmos chains.
- [osmojs](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osmojs)) - Easily compose and broadcast Osmosis and Cosmos messages.
- [osmosis-frontend](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-frontend) - Frontend implementation for the Osmosis blockchain. There are many front-ends in the ecosystem. Includes npm packages for [math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osmosis-labs/math), [pools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osmosis-labs/pools), and data [stores](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osmosis-labs/stores) to enable other developers to quickly create their own Osmosis frontends.

### Cosmwasm ecosystem

- [beaker](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/beaker) - Dev tooling for cosmwasm contracts.
- [osmosis-rust](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-rust) - Library of Stargate messages, queries and bindings for Osmosis, along with sample contracts.

<!-- (TODO: Link to sample contracts here) -->
